# Kotlin-Calisthenics

This is a fantasy word (and possibly language) generator written as an excercise that will attempt to follow
the Object Calisthenics rules https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf
and also some of the Functional Calisthenics rules https://codurance.com/2017/10/12/functional-calisthenics/ 
(as much as the language limitations of Kotlin will allow.)
