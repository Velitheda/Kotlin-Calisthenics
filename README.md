# Kotlin-Calisthenics

This is a fantasy word (and possibly language) generator written as an exercise that will attempt to follow
the Object Calisthenics rules https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf
and also some of the Functional Calisthenics rules https://codurance.com/2017/10/12/functional-calisthenics/ 
(as much as the language limitations of Kotlin will allow.)

I will also challenge myself to follow TDD and BDD as much as possible

For following the evolving direction of the of the project, see User-Stories.txt as I will try to follow and approach
of writing and then implementing them as I go along.
